Scuffed Terraria is a pretty shit mod.
It really is.
Please don't download this.
You can't go back.

This mod adds 1 npc, the propaganda minister with which you can exchange social credit for weapons.
This mod also adds 4 enemies and a variety of completely overpowered weapons.
This is my first mod so pls don't expect anything great from it!
